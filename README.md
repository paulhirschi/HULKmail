# HULK mail
*not for the weak or faint of heart*
![Hulk Mail](HULKmail.png)
I created HULKmail out of a desire to become familiar with the **AngularJS** JavaScript framework. It was a joy to use.

Play around with it live [here](http://www.hulkmail.paulhirschi.com).

I didn't create it with responsiveness in mind, so it won't render well on small devices.

Readable code exists in the `app` directory.
